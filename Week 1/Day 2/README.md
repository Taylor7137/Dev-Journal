Reflect:

I feel alright about my first webpage, but would like to learn much more of what's going on behind the seens. 

Understanding what is actually going on.

I have a question about what the server.js is actually doing as well as the npm function.

Review:

1.)DOCTYPE specifies the document type.

2.)<head> </head> is a functional heading on html which houses the heading material for the webpage. THE BIG THING TO NOTE IS THAT EVERYTHING INSIDE THE HEAD IS NOT DISPLAYABLE ON THE SURFACE FRONT OF THE WEBPAGE BY ORDINARY MEANS.
 <body> </body> is the body material for the webpage and is shown on the webpage.
