Reflect:

A: What was the most frustrating thing about today? 

Q: Nothing!

A: Why do you think that good code conventions are in place?

Q: To efficient debug.

A: How would you describe the box model to someone that has never seen a computer?

Q: It's like a box.


Review:

1: List all of the errors that you found today:
    -spelling errors,
    -colons instead of semi-colons, 
    -"0" instead of "O",
    -brackets,
    
2: How would you make sure that you do not suffer through what we did today?
    Be careful
    
3: What is padding? 
    It is a fitting around the text, like an invisible box BEFORE the border(the only visually observable thing, unlike the padding)
    
4. What is margin?
    If the padding is the invisible inner layer, inside the border between the text, THEN the margin is the invisible OUTTER layer, outside the border.
    
5. What does the following do?
    a:hover {
        background-color: #FFF;}
    
    }
    
    When one's cursor "hovers" over an area, the areas background-color becomes #FFF.
