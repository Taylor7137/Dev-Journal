Reflect:
What do you think about
the code-along procedure
of the class? 

A: I like it some. I think we need to do stuff more on our OWN because it we are just copying you and not using our own brain power to CREATE.

What would
be the alternative if you
do not?

A: We create original code of our own, NO COPYING at ALL.


What is your greatest
obstacle to creating a web
application at this point?

A: Making it so everyone can see it from their own computers.

What is one thing
that you could do to get
better with JavaScript?

A: Be introduced to more code and then practice it our my Own. In class there is not enough new material.
