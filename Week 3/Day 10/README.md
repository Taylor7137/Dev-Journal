Reflect:

1. You have learned three different languages up until this point, which one is the easiest to you, HTML, CSS, or JavaScript? Why?

JavaScript, because it is most like the code I grew up on.

2. We have just touched on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, what was the most difficult concept of those three things to you?

How we use all those to create a web page that everyone can see and not just me on my computer.

3. What is a site that you could build with your skills up until this point?

I can build a static page, that only I can see.



Review:

1. I need to grab a button, with the id 'clicky' and the classes 'btn btn-default', to change the styling when the button is clicked. Which one of the JavaScript selector functions would you use?

var clicky = documents.getElementById("clicky");

2. What are some of the events that you can 'listen' for and respond to with the DOM elements?

mouseenter
mouseleave
click
arrowup 
scrollup

3. What is provided to you when you use the getElementByld? How is the different than the getElementsByClass?

you get one element for getElementsById

and

you get a collect of element(s) for getElementsByClass
