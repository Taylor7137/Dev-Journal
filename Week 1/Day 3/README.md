    h1- heading tag of the largest type.
    h3- heading tag of the third largest type.
    li- an element within a list.
    ul- unordered list. Makes bullet points of the elements within the list.
    ol- ordered list. Makes a numbered list of the elements within the list.
    span- I have no idea.
    div- I assume it divides things.
    em- emphasizes things, ie. italicizes things.
    strong- means the things are strong, ie. bolds things.
    p- stands for paragraph, ie. the items within it will all be on the same line or if there is a lot of stuff (too much for one line) it will be in the same paragraph. (Not double spaced below the line)
