Reflect:

I thought the first day of class was great.

It is difficult to say whether my learnign style is going to work well at this point.



Review:

I have many questions, mostly about minute details of coding. Also interesting in your(Justin's) background in Math and Physics. 

git status-  promts whether the file one is commanding "git status on" is current/up to date on GIT after any changes have been made. ONLY USEFUL in GIT BASH COMMAND WINDOW.

git add-  "Adds", so to speak, the current file you are commanding the "git add" onto to the GIT database. HOWEVER, it adds it to a middle space, not the final GIT database. ONLY USEFUL in GIT BASH COMMAND WINDOW.

git commit- "Commits" the file your are using this command on to the 'final' GIT database. ('final database' in this case refers to the GIT database that is useable.) ONLY USEFUL in GIT BASH COMMAND WINDOW.

cd-  this command is used is the directory to change directory/folder to the folder you type after the cd command.

ls- lists the files/folders in the current folder you are on. 

mkdir- makes a new directory/folder in the current folder you are in.

touch - IMPORTANT. Adds a FILE/document to the current directory/folder you are in.
