Reflect:

Answer the following
questions:

This class can be difficult
at times, how does it
compare to the things
that you have done
before?

It is not very difficult, and I would like to dispose of the concept that this is difficult because that somewhat validates it.
Each time someone says it's difficult, one believes that it is just a little bit more which is a destructive course of action. Do without expressing the interjection that it is difficult. 

We all have our own ideas
and ways that we prefer
to accomplish tasks, how
do you think that people
would fair if the class was
run the way you prefer?

Indeterminent, They would fair. 



Review:
Describe, in words not code,
how you would accomplish
each of the following:
1. Add a mouseenter event
handler to every anchor
tag on the page that
changes the text size.


Define the anchors in javascript, then add an Event listener to listen for when the mouse enters the anchors' domain on the page. In addition, I would make a function to execute when the event listener is engaged. The function would change the text size of the anchors.


2. Add a user login page to
your website so that
people only see the pages
you want them to see.

Not sure.

3. Position an image in the
center of the page.

use (margin: auto) in the styling of the image and make sure the height and width of the parent element is the max it can be and it itself is in the middle of the page. This method depends on the positioning of the parent element, so it is difficult to say exactly without typing an annoying, exhaustive, unreadable description.
